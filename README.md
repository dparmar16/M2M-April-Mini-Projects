# M2M-April-Mini-Projects
I will do doing weekly analysis with a different data source each time.

An inspiration for this comes from G. Elliott Morris and his ad-hoc deep dives into political data using R.

FiveThirtyEight has a bunch of data available, and I may start there.

Possible analyses include:

Looking at how endorsements correlate with standings in the polls (combine endorsements data and polling data)
Doing a trend analysis on Donald Trumpâ€™s approval rating
Compare how Democratic candidates are doing across different states
Happy April.
