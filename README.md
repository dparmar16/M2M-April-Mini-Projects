# M2M-April-Mini-Projects
The purpose of this repo is to post my weekly analysis, with a different data source each time.

An inspiration for this comes from [G. Elliott Morris](https://twitter.com/gelliottmorris?lang=en) and his [ad-hoc deep dives into political data using R](https://www.thecrosstab.com/2019/03/22/economic-voting/).

FiveThirtyEight has a [wide variety of data available](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/), and I may start there.

Possible analyses include:
======

* Looking at how endorsements correlate with standings in the polls (combine endorsements data and polling data)  
* Doing a trend analysis on Donald Trumpâ€™s approval rating  
* Compare how Democratic candidates are doing across different states  

Happy April.
